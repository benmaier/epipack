class StochasticEpiModel():
    """
    A general class to define any
    compartmental epidemiological model
    that can be run in a well-mixed
    system or on a weighted, directed network.
    By default, the epidemiological process is considered
    to run in a well-mixed system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    compartments : :obj:`list` of :obj:`string`
        A list containing compartment strings.
    N_nodes : int
        The number of nodes in the system.
    edge_weight_tuples : list of tuples of (int, int, float), default = None
        Choose this ption
        The links along which transmissions can take place.

        .. code:: python

            [ (source_id, target_id, weight), ... ]

    directed : bool, default = False
        If `directed` is False, each entry in the edge_weight_tuples
        is considered to equally point from `target_id` to `source_id`
        with weight `weight`.
    well_mixed_mean_contact_number : int, default = 1
        By default, the epidemiological process is considered to run
        in a well-mixed population where for each link-transmission
        event, a node is assumed to have contact to exactly one
        other node. Increase this contact number by adjusting this
        parameter.

    Attributes
    ----------
    compartments : :obj:`list` of :obj:`string`
        A list containing strings or other hash-able types
        that describe each compartment,
        (e.g. "S", "I", etc.).
    N_comp : :obj:`int`
        Number of compartments (including population number)
    node_status : numpy.ndarray of int
        Each entry gives the compartment that the
        corresponding node is part of.
